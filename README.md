# Renovate Configuration

This repository contains organization-wide [Renovate presets](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/). The [default configuration](default.json) stored here is an [organization preset](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/#organization-level-presets) and will be automatically used for the onboarding PR for any new repository. 

Configuration in this repository is managed by Terraform and should not be edited directly.
